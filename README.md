## Telco Churn – End-to-End ML Project
### Purpose

Build and ship a full machine-learning solution for predicting customer churn in a telecom setting—from data prep and modeling to an API(Fast api) + WEB UI (streamlit)

### Problem solved & benefits

- Faster decisions: Predicts which customers are likely to churn so teams can act before they leave.
- Operationalized ML: Model is accessible via a REST API and a simple UI; anyone can test it without notebooks.
- Repeatable delivery: CI/CD + containers mean every change can be rebuilt, tested, and redeployed in a consistent way.
- Traceable experiments: MLflow tracks runs, metrics, and artifacts for reproducibility and auditing.

### What I built

- Data & Modeling: Feature engineering + XGBoost classifier; experiments logged to MLflow.
- Model tracking: Runs, metrics, and the serialized model logged under a named MLflow experiment.
- Inference service: FastAPI app exposing /predict (POST) and a root health check /.
- Web UI: Streamlit interface mounted at /ui for quick, shareable manual testing.

### Roadblocks & how we solved them

Unhealthy targets behind ALB

- Cause: App didn’t respond at the health-check path; listener/target port mismatches.
- Fixes: Added GET / health endpoint; confirmed ALB listener on 80 forwards to TG on 8000; TG health check path set to /.

Module import error in container (ModuleNotFoundError: serving)

- Cause: Python path in the image didn’t include src/.
- Fixes: Set PYTHONPATH=/app/src in the Dockerfile; corrected uvicorn app path to src.app.main:app.

Gradio UI error (“No runs found in experiment”)

- Cause: Inference/UI expected an MLflow-logged model but couldn’t resolve a run.
- Fixes: Standardized MLflow experiment name and model logging in training; inference loads the logged model consistently (and a local path for dev).
